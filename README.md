# OOP-assignment3 - HASSAPP - An Android App To help Small Business's Comply with HACCP Regulations
##Student Number : C14363641 

For my Third OOP Assignment I thought I would take on a Bigger task than my previous and Build an App , I Used An Idea
I had been Thinking about , As I work in a Food Business and understand that it's hard for small business's to comply with Regulations
while keeping costs low , and hiring specialists To set up their HACCP compliance routine is Costly.
I started from the bottom on this Assignment and never had Used Android Studio before this , So it was a Slow and frustrating yet Fun Experience.
Problems that arised during development  
*AMD virtualization Didnt work within android studio no matter which version of the sdk's I downloaded so after hour's of trouble-shooting I settled and used Geny-Motion Emulator
*Adb server not detecting any devices , virtual machines or physical phones plugged in , more Hours spent on this.
*Android Studio Performance Issues and Crashing ...

##Objective 
My Objective of this assignment was to have an app where a business could download it , register and sign in with our server and store their information on our datavase,
then be sent to a decision tree where they are given a number of questions and use a swipe gesture to answer yes (swipe right) or no (swipe left) and eventually hit and end point where we 
found out what type of business the user is and can now deliver our content.
Our content is a PDF document which the user prints out and a Tutorial video , both hosted on our server so we can update/alter them as we wish without changing the app's code / rolling out a patch or update.

###Decision Tree
The Decision Tree caused much head-ache as I wasnt sure How I could implement it without being Clunky with alot of activities ,
 I tried a few different methods but Couldnt get them working the way I needed to so I just switched activites with intent's upon left/right fling motion.
 This is definitely something I would need to sort out before I scale up the decision tree as now its merely a concept and has no real accuracy

###Conclusion
I spent alot of time on this app , and had alot more features that I would like to add to it before I submitted but didnt have time.
I spend the majority of my time on this project actually learning how to use android studio and then the last week implementing all of my mini-projects that I had done whilst watching tutorials and reading online , 
Into what I feel is a decent enough app with alot of potential.
Im very happy with how it turned out , and This is the first Project I have entailed on in programming where I am eager to keep going with it and add new features and get it on the app-store.
